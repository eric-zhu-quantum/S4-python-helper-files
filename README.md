# S4-python-helper-files
Helper files for computing optical spectra from S4 (Stanford Stratified Structure Solver) in a multi-threaded fashion

SpectralScan - Python Module that takes an S4 simulation object and obtains the optical spectrum for a wavelength range in a multithreaded fashion.  

EricFitter - Fits optical spectrum data (wavelength, transmission/reflection) and fits it to a Fano/Lorentzian peak.
