# S4-python-helper-files
Helper files for computing optical spectra from S4 (Stanford Stratified Structure Solver) in a multi-threaded fashion.

### SpectralScan 
Python Module that takes an S4 simulation object and obtains the optical spectrum for a wavelength range in a multithreaded fashion.  

### EricFitter
Takes optical spectrum data (wavelength, transmission/reflection) generated by S4 and fits it to a Fano/Lorentzian peak.

More info about S4 can be found here:

I compiled my S4 Python Module after downloading the modified source and following the instructions from:

### Tutorial/Example Files: 

#### [Tutorial_HelperFiles](https://github.com/eric-zhu-quantum/S4-python-helper-files/blob/master/Tutorial_HelperFiles.ipynb)
A demo on how to use SpectralScan to generate a spectrum of a guided mode resonance (GMR) of a Photonic Crystal Slab (PCS) in a multi-threaded fashion, and fit the peak to a Fano resonance with EricFitter.  

#### [Tutorial_XsectionTutorial](https://github.com/eric-zhu-quantum/S4-python-helper-files/blob/master/Tutorial_XsectionTutorial.ipynb)
Obtain a fitted peak for a GMR of a PCS, and obtain the mode-field distribution of the GMR inside a unit cell.
