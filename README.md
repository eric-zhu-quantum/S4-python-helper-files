Helper files for computing optical spectra from S4 (Stanford Stratified Structure Solver) in a multi-threaded fashion

SpectralScan - Python Module that takes an S4 simulation object and obtains the optical spectrum for a wavelength range in a multithreaded fashion.  

EricFitter - Takes optical spectrum data (wavelength, transmission/reflection) generated by S4 and fits it to a Fano/Lorentzian peak.  


More info about S4 can be found here:

I compiled my S4 Python Module from source after following the instructions from:
